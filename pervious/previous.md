# International Social Survey Programme: Social Attitudes Survey New Zealand

COMPASS has run the ISSP survey for New Zealand since 2013. The ISSP is a continuing annual programme of cross-national collaboration on surveys covering topics important for social science research [(http://www.issp.org)](http://www.issp.org). It brings together pre-existing social science projects and coordinates research goals, thereby adding a cross-national, cross-cultural perspective to the individual national studies. ISSP researchers especially concentrate on developing questions that are meaningful and relevant to all countries, and can be expressed in an equivalent manner in all relevant languages. There are 48 countries that contribute data to the ISSP. COMPASS became a member officially in 2016. We have rebranded the survey as the **Social Attitudes Survey New Zealand** for an audience unfamiliar with the ISSP.

The data sets and metadata for all of the ISSP surveys for New Zealand can be downloaded from our area of the University's Figshare repository at [http://auckland.figshare.com/COMPASS](http://auckland.figshare.com/COMPASS). The surveys from 1991 to 2010 were run by Professor Phil Gendall, out of the Department of Marketing at Massey University, an impressive achievement.

Further specific information on the surveys that we as COMPASS have run has come substantially from summer students that we have been privileged to host over the years, as well as from COMPASS staff. These have included efforts to apply survey weights to the data sets, as well as ensuring that we meet the requirements of the international body, especially in terms of the derivations of demographic variables.
